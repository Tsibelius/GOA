            <b><li>The "Dodge Challenger"</li></b> <b>is the name of three different generations of automobiles produced by the American automobile manufacturer Dodge.</b> However, the first use of <b>the Challenger name by Dodge dates back to <u>1959</u> for marketing a "value version" of the full-sized Coronet Silver Challenger.</b><br>

            From model years <u>1970</u> to <u>1974</u>, <b>the first-generation Dodge Challenger pony car was built using the Chrysler E platform in hardtop and convertible body styles sharing major components with the Plymouth Barracuda.[2]</b><br>
            
            <b>The second generation, from model years <u>1978</u> to <u>1983</u>, was a badge engineered Mitsubishi Galant Lambda / Sapporo,[3] a coupe version of an economical compact car.</b> <br>
            
            <b>The third and current generation is a full-size muscle car that was introduced in early 2008 originally as a rival to the evolved fifth generation Ford Mustang and the fifth generation Chevrolet Camaro.[4]</b> <br>
            
            <b>In November 2021, Stellantis announced that 2023 model year would be the final model year for both the LD Dodge Charger and LA Dodge Challenger, as the company will focus its future plans on electric vehicles rather than fossil fuel powered vehicles, due to tougher emissions standards required by the Environmental Protection Agency for the 2023 model year.[5] Challenger production ended on December 22, 2023, and the Brampton, Ontario assembly plant will be re-tooled to assemble an electrified successor.[6]</b> <br>
