            <h2 style="color: antiquewhite;">Most paraglider pilots eagerly await the spring. The long, cold winter months deter most pilots from flying, instead they wait for the milder temperatures and the exhilarating thermals that come with flying during this turbulent season.

However, spring is also the paragliding season in which most accidents happen, as a combination of the challenging flying conditions and the lack of practice carried out by gliders over the winter. 

Because of the nature of the sport, paragliding mistakes are often serious. 

With this in mind, we’ve compiled a few tips to help you return to paragliding safely and enjoy your best flying season yet.

Get in shape.

Most of us are pretty inactive over the winter – with the cold stopping us from spending as much time out and about, and the holidays encouraging us to relax and indulge – meaning that, come spring, we’re not as strong or as fit as we once were.

This is bad news for our paragliding skills, as the sport requires exceptional balance and strength in order to take off and land safely. Flying can also drain energy, so being in shape is required. 

What’s more: spring is known for its often challenging weather conditions, as there are typically stronger thermals in this season than any other, making it extra tough on the body.

So, try to improve your strength and balance before hitting up your favourite flying sites by undergoing strength training of your arms, legs, core and retraining your balance – yoga can be useful here.

Get your reserve repacked.

The official advice encourages paragliders to have their reserve repacked twice a year.

It’s a great idea to have your reserve repacked before you enter the spring paragliding season if you haven’t for a while, as it’s likely your reserve has been in your pack undisturbed for a long time. Deep creases may have formed during this time and may prevent your reserve from deploying effectively.

Plus, the moisture and any dirt from the previous paragliding season may still be present, which you’ll want to remove to ensure the continued function of your reserve.</h2>
