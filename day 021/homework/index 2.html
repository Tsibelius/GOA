           <h2 style="color:black ;"> In autumn, nature changes its scenery, offering paragliders breathtaking panoramas. The authentic charm of this season allows you to admire the wild, natural beauty of the landscape. The trees change colour and fallen leaves adorn the paths. <br> The sunsets are a memorable experience, set against a backdrop of brilliantly coloured vegetation.

            Taking to the skies from the top of a mountain at the end of the day is a particularly warm experience in September and October. You'll be able to contemplate shimmering streams, colourful trees, enchanting forests and skies as far as the eye can see.
            
            This calm season, for example, is ideal for a tandem paragliding flight over the mountains or valleys marked by the pretty autumn colours.</h2>
