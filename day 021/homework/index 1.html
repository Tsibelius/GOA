            <h2>it’s summertime. The skies are blue and the breeze is warm. <br> What better way to complement your summer trip out to the beaches of Long Island than with skydiving out of a perfectly good airplane. <br>

Skydiving may not be at the top of your summer vacation to-do list, but we think it should be. <br> For one, think of the views you’d get from 10,000 feet as you cool off above miles of pristine beaches.

Located 13 miles from West Hampton and 50 miles west of Montauk, we’re the perfect pit stop on your way out to the Hamptons. In fact, you can see Montauk from altitude!</h2>
