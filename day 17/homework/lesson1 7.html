            <b>The new Ford Mustang <i> "Dark Horse"</i> may be the one that’s generating all the headlines at the moment but as far as Mustangs go, none can quite match the insanity that is the <u>2020</u> Mustang Shelby GT500, a car with supercar levels of power at a fraction of the cost.</b><br>


            <b>The following Shelby GT500 was delivered to a Ford dealer in Folsom, California back in September 2020 and has only been driven 2,000-odd miles (~3,200 km) so in reality, it should be as good as new. The exterior is quite restrained as far as GT500s go thanks to the Magnetic Metallic paint finish with Shadow Black racing stripes and bright red accents. <br>

            <b>A host of optional extras add to the car’s appeal. The Bring a Trailer listing notes it is fitted with the available Carbon Fiber Track Pack with new wickers on the front splitter and a manually-adjustable carbon fiber rear wing. The car has also been equipped with 20-inch seven-spoke carbon fiber wheels wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires that measure 305/30 at the front and 315/30 at the rear. <br> If we were buying a GT500, we wouldn’t go with the carbon fiber wheels out of fear of damaging them but they definitely look good and help to save some weight.
