            <b>The <i>Ford GT</i> is a mid-engine two-seater sports car manufactured and marketed by American automobile manufacturer Ford for the 2005 model year in conjunction with the company's <u>2003</u> centenary. The second generation Ford GT became available for the 2017 model year.[1] </b>

<b>The GT recalls Ford's historically significant GT40, a consecutive four-time winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans (<u>1966â€“1969</u>), including a 1-2-3 finish in <u>1966</u>.</b>

<b>This history has inspired many movies, including the 2019 film Ford v Ferrari. In this film, they show the story of the development of the Ford GT40 Mk I. The car was designed by Carroll Shelby, Phil Remington, and race car driver Ken Miles.</b>
